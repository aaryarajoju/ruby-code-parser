Spring 2025 Final,E2542,Refactor Review Bidding Controller,,,"I recommend a score of 96. The code is more concise, employs constants effectively, and makes good use of before_action filters and service objects to improve organization and readability.

What worked...
Complex logic has been refactored into shorter, more focused methods.
Magic numbers and strings have been replaced with well-named constants for clarity and maintainability.
Using before_action keeps controllers lean and enforces DRY principles.
Placing business logic in services enhances testability and separates concerns.

What needs to be updated...(recommendations by professor)
Change the button text from RunBiddingAlgorithm to Assign Reviews to better reflect its purpose.
The AssignBiddingService and BiddingAlgorithmService share the process_bidding logic. Consider combining them into a single service to avoid duplication.
Instead of having a standalone CompleteReviewCountingService, integrate that functionality into the ResponseMap model",,95,,"The new bidding review algorithm was a well-organized enhancement that preserved all existing functionality in the review_bids_controller and review_bid endpoints. The UI demo walked through course creation, participant and topic setup, team formation, bid assignment, and impersonating students to place bids via the “Run review algorithm” button. Business logic was refactored into focused service objects, magic literals have been replaced with named constants, and controllers are leaner thanks to before_action filters, all of which contribute to improved readability, maintainability, and testability. 

A few refinements would polish the solution further. Several methods lack explanatory comments and stray debug statements should be removed. The naming of permission checks (ALLOWED_ROLES), action methods (ensure_valid_topics, process_bidding), and services (AssignBiddingService vs. BiddingAlgorithmService) could be standardized, and shared logic between those two services should be consolidated. The button label in the UI should be changed from “RunBiddingAlgorithm” to “Assign Reviews,” and the standalone review-counting service should be implemented in the ResponseMap model. It makes better sense there.",,,Janice Uwujaren

",,"The team did solid work refactoring the student-teams functionality. However, the scope of changes was so broad that it introduces a high risk of unintended breakages. I would not recommend merging in its current state.

The magnitude of simultaneous changes makes it difficult to verify correctness. Smaller, targeted refactors would reduce risk and make review/testing more manageable.

Core functionality around team membership and participation is much clearer and better organized than before.

The professor recommended:
Remove obsolete method: def self.first_by_team_id
Relocate team_empty functionality to Team model instead of TeamParticipant to better align responsibilities
Rename add_member_to_invited_team. Current name is confusing and overly long - may be better to say add_member_to_inviting_team.
",,93,,"The refactor of teams_users into teams_participants with a new TeamsParticipantsController, accompanying tests, and updated UI showing students’ assignments has made the team membership functionality clearer, but the scope of changes introduces significant risk. The build is currently failing multiple checks, including a high-severity security vulnerability, tests aren’t running reliably (possibly due to duplicate databases), and there are over 70 Code Climate issues. There are also several orphaned or poorly named methods (delete_selected, self.first_by_team_id, self.add_member_to_invited_team, and others) and leftover debug statements. To safely merge, the team should address the security vulnerabilities, remove or clarify obsolete methods, relocate responsibilities, rename confusing methods, and break the work into smaller, targeted refactors to make review and testing more manageable.",,,Janice Uwujaren

API documentation is complete, and major endpoints like add_reviewer and save_grade_and_comment_for_reviewer were implemented correctly.

A lot of the content is in the form of lists.  It would be helpful to have text explaining what is in the lists, rather than just displaying the list.  Also, I am concerned that some of the list items were what you guessed rather than what you knew.  For example, for add_calibration, you said, ""Creates calibration review mappings between instructors and teams, Validates permissions and prevents duplicate calibrations.""  Now a calibration review is when a student reviews a work that the instructor has already reviewed, so that we can see if the student's assessment agrees with the instructor's.  I don't know what ""prevents duplicate calibrations"" would be about.  Guessing at the meaning of code can seriously mislead a reader who assumes that the documentation reflects reality.",Anish Rao Toorpu

Great use of constants in the code. 
Each method performs one responsibility.
Methods have been simplified to support Controller responsibilities and all business logic has been moved to a service object.
No code smells that I can see.
Excellent test coverage.",,96,94,"Feedback Summary:
The team has done a solid job reimplementing the project. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows Rails conventions closely. There are no obvious code smells, and the test suite helps to ensure the stability and maintainability of the application.

1. Authorization & Routing
What’s working: You’ve correctly extracted authorization checks into before_action callbacks, keeping the controller lean.

Room for improvement: Add authorize_participants as a before_action on the list action to ensure only permitted users can view that endpoint.

2. Refactoring & Separation of Concerns
What’s working: You’ve simplified the list method, moving business rules into a dedicated service object. This makes the controller's role clear and keeps your business logic encapsulated.

Why it matters: Controllers should only coordinate HTTP requests, response rendering, and parameter passing. All heavy lifting belongs in models or service classes.

3. HTTP-Specific Logic
Good practice: The controller now focuses strictly on HTTP concerns—receiving requests, handling params, setting status codes, and passing data to views.

4. Code Quality & Testing
Strengths:
Using strong parameters and adhering to RESTful naming conventions.
Excellent use of constants throughout the codebase.
Test coverage is solid—both unit and integration tests are in place, and critical paths are well exercised.

Next steps:
Integrate code-coverage metrics into your CI pipeline so everyone can see coverage trends at a glance.

Continue to expand edge-case tests, especially around authorization failures and error handling.

5. Documentation & Clarity
Suggestion: Add brief inline comments in a few spots to explain non-obvious decisions. For example, where you mix a constant with a literal value in the controller, annotate why each is used. This will help future developers understand the difference immediately.

The grade calculation logic is now delegated to relevant classes (response.rb, response_map.rb). The team has fulfilled the requirements of the project and did a fantastic job. While grades_helper.rb and penalty_helper.rb are currently well-structured and readable, they are misclassified as helpers, they contain controller-level and business logic, which violates Rails conventions and the Single Responsibility Principle. Helpers should be limited to view-related tasks, not domain or authorization logic. All test cases for the controller have passed; however, changes span across multiple files, and currently only the main controller is covered by tests. The additional modified components have not yet been explicitly tested.  update_team is a confusing method name.  A lot of method names are unclear, using names like get_this, get_that.  With further analysis, the code could be made much more readable.",,"B N
This is a very good low-level description of the changes that were made. However, it would have been better if it explained what the grades controller was, and how its responsibilities could best be implemented.

The adherence to DRY and SOLID principles is evident through the modular design and clear separation of concerns between the controller actions and model responsibilities. The use of RESTful routes in the routes.rb file and clear separation in the controller methods are good practices. However, further adherence to these principles could be enhanced by abstracting complex logic in the model into service objects or query objects, especially the complex queries in feedback_response_report.
The naming conventions across the files are consistent and meaningful, which enhances readability and maintainability of the code. Comments in the code are generally useful, providing clarity on the purpose of methods and important business logic, although some methods like feedback_response_report could benefit from more detailed comments explaining the logic step-by-step, particularly for complex conditional logic.
As for the remaining tasks, the team should focus on thoroughly testing the email functionality and the feedback response report to ensure reliability and robustness.

They also did a good job introducting the fallback algorithm in the event that the service is down. In the private class method send_bidding_request, they should be returning HTTP response where success is true, data is the JSON-parsed response object, and error is nil, and when false success isfalse, data is nill and there is an error messge and not simply false - this is a mismatch with the response they are returning when successful. They should also include a timeout for the service. They should also be consistent with comments - they have specific documents including defining parameters and return value for run_bidding_algoritm but do not do the same for process_bidding. Also after debugging, remove any debugging logic from thde code.

However, there are opportunities for improvement in the list.html.erb.html and routes.rb files. The list.html.erb.html file could benefit from better separation of HTML and embedded Ruby code, as well as the elimination of inline styles, which would improve the maintainability and scalability of the view layer. The routes.rb file, while generally well-structured, shows some redundancy in route definitions that could be streamlined to avoid potential confusion and routing errors.

4) Added test cases after refactoring the existing test suite to test the newly added code.
5) Better comments on the code needed, to better explain what the method is doing, and some methods like set_student_quiz should be named Ruby like.

We merged the old file into the new repo.  NO!  They were told not to do that.
They moved calculate_score to get_score (of course, they shouldn't calculate the score in the controller!)
They moved a process_answers method to ResponseMap.
They have new functionality for """"skippable"""" questions (actually, to prohibit skipping certain questions). (But the rubric would also have to support that, and that's not part of their project.)
A ResourceFinder was put into their controller.
Fixed the magic-constant code for finding an instructor.
Made changes to make tests work.
Then they go to Postman tests for API calls, test all the routes.
Delete quiz ... shouldn 't that be in in questionnaires_controller? No -- they're deleting the QUIZ, not the questionnaire

It seemingly would be pretty easy to fix them.,,94,95,"The team has implemented practical improvements to the code structure and functionality, significantly enhancing maintainability and usability. By refactoring the assessments_for method into smaller, single-purpose methods and introducing scopes, they have improved code readability and organization. The addition of new accessor and retrieval methods, such as latest_responses_for_team_by_reviewer and response_count, streamlines access to key data. Furthermore, the safe_delete method reinforces data integrity.

Their suite of RSpec tests effectively covers validations, scopes, and custom methods, reflecting a strong commitment to ensuring reliable functionality.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Naming Conventions: Some method names could be made more idiomatic to Ruby. Avoid conjunctions in identifiers, as they can hinder readability and don't align with typical Ruby naming practices.
2. Polymorphic Design: Instead of checking the type of a response map to determine if a review is submitted, consider overriding a method in ReviewResponseMap that inherits from ResponseMap. This adheres to the principles of object-oriented design and improves extensibility.
3. Invalid ID Handling: Clarify the definition of invalid_id.

For instance, there is a focus on user roles (TAs, instructors, administrators) despite the fact that only students are allowed to create or update bookmarks. These tests are unnecessary and result in a DRY violation. The tests should focus specifically on student actions and ensure more relevant edge cases and performance scenarios are covered.

However, including authorization utilities in the pull request is unnecessary and could lead to merge conflicts if versions differ.

For the edit method, they effectively relocate sorting and team-checking logic to the Response model and application_controller.rb, enhancing separation of concerns. Additionally, the student reduces multiple calls to sort_questions, renaming it to sort_items for clarity, and creates a dedicated helper method for response locking to eliminate repetitive code. By updating methods like questionnaire_from_response_map to accept parameters, they ensure greater reusability and conformity to DRY principles. Clear comparisons between the old and new code versions illustrate each change’s purpose, demonstrating a well-thought-out approach to implementing efficient, modular code. To further improve this project, the student should concentrate on how to avoid code scattering by ensuring that related functionalities remain cohesive and logically grouped, making it easier for future developers to locate and understand the complete functionality within the ResponsesController. For example, consolidating sorting, team-checking, and response-locking functionalities into a dedicated service or helper would reduce code scattering and simplify maintenance.

It's probably not good design to introduce it specially for this project.

Additionally, copyHandler method contain more comments than necessary, which could be streamlined for improved readability.  The Select an Instructor functionality is unlikely to be useful, as instructors always create their own courses. In the case that they can't, an administrator could impersonate them to create the course.  The implementors seem to have designed their own icons.  I'd rather reuse the current icons.

It contains links to code at appopriate places.  The page explains the design patterns that were used.  This is good, but the reference to Composite is incorrect; if it were Composite, a course could be nested inside a course, which is not possible.  I'm also not sure that the Tooltip is an instance of Decorator.  It is Decorator only if the same actions can be performed on an object with or without the tooltip.

I am also confused by, ""After the deadline, if a student fails to bid the topics to review, the run bid algorithm allocated topics to the student after the instructor runs the run bidding algorithm,"" because if a student DOES bid, the bidding algorithm allocates them topics too.

They have really done a good job in reimplementing the participants page according to the backend. They also changed URLs, which makes sense and connects to the backend. They changed the add participant form according to Participants.rb, which was having only assignment_id and user_id, hence they made the form have the user dropdown and removed edit functionality in action since it's a dropdown that would allow the instructor/admin to select from a list of all 10000+ users. This is a good idea, but it requires sending a lot of data to the front end, so its performance should be tested with all 10000+ users to make sure it does not slow down the menu by too much.  Email preferences are listed for participants.  While that might be done in the current system, it does not make sense to reimplement it, because email preferences relate to the user's account overall, and not to the user's participation in this assignment.  These columns should be removed to avoid cluttering the display. (BTW, there's potential confusion on the word ""Role"".  Each account has a role (Student, etc.), but the participant also has a role in this assignment, as a submitter, a reviewer, a ""participant"" (submit AND review) or a ""reader"" (just take the quiz on the artifact).  It's even more important to show the participant's role in the assignment than it is to show what kind of account they have.  Please be thinking of a way that it can be shown without confusion.  A potential drawback is that the table UI is not good when it comes to the search filter and could have added information hover for the email preferences. Since searching will rarely be necessary, the search bars should be hidden by default, until the user clicks on a ""spyglass"" icon to show them.

However, I question whether it is a good idea to use popups in the UI.  The current UI uses tabs instead.  It is easier to switch between tabs than to bring up different popups. Moreover, in the Assignment popup, the meaning of several terms is unclear.  What is ""Submitter count""?  Is the ""Number of reviews"" the amount that a student is required to do, the maximum amount that the student is allowed to do, or the number of reviews that need to be done for each submission?  The ""Number of reviews of reviews"" (metareviews) is used so rarely that it should not even be shown by default.

Also, I prefer the current Expertiza widgets to the ones used here for Actions, which are too light to be clear at a glance.  In ""Improved User Dropdown Selection"", could you restrict the instructors shown to those who have taught courses at the Institution selected above?  That would simplify the search.  But, on second thought, only Administrators would ever need to choose an instructor.  Instructors can create courses only for themselves.

Refactored functions like assign_reviewer_dynamically and add_reviewer. Corresponding changes were made to their respective tests. Additionally, efforts were made to improve code readability and understanding by correcting and adding comments. Method names were revised to better reflect their purposes. Code Climate issues were fixed. Some methods are so short as to be unnecessary though, such as find_assignment which results in 3 lines of code being added for a very self-explanatory single line of code. Some methods, like assign_reviewer, are quite lengthy and handle multiple responsibilities, including error checking, finding records, and redirecting. Extracting some of this inline code into separate, smaller methods could improve readability and maintainability. Too many comments lack insight - the top-level comments are helpful in places to explain what methods do in more detail, but many of the comments just reiterate the following line of code and only end up adding visual clutter. Some tests for the controller are failing which should be addressed.

In assign_reviewer_without_topic(assignment, reviewer), it seems that assigning the reviewer should be the same whether or not there are topics, though different logic would be used to figure out which submission to assign a reviewer to.  Could the assignment be factored out of this method and other assignment methods, to reduce DRY violations?",,"Very good job of describing the motivation for changes made to the code.

They also added a toggle for the column in the heatgrid in case it does not need to be viewed. The example they picked for a metric was a count of how many review responses for a particular rubric item contained more than 10 words in the comment. This metric would not be of much interest to most users. However, a bigger issue is the fact that each time a new metric is added, two view files would need to be edited: assignments/edit/_general.html.erb and grades/view_team.html.erb, the latter in two places. These files have little to do with metrics, so requiring them to change introduces higher coupling than desirable. Most of the tests are also closely tied to this metric, which suggests that if new metrics are added, new tests would also have to be written. A further issue is that the new code contains no comments.

The actual purpose of this project was to write tests for students being able to review their own team, and to rename the metric-1 column with a toggle. It doesn't appear this first issue was addressed, although there are some tests for the new Verbose Comment Count metric. Despite their work on the metric problem, there is a bug with the round review display. To get reviews from multiple rounds to show up in the heatgrid, it is necessary to check the box, ""Rubric varies by round."" This means that first-round reviews cannot be shown if the rubric is the same in Round 1 and Round 2. And if the checkbox is checked, then Round 2 reviews are shown twice.

",Yes,,,98,95,This project is regarding testing the functionality of deleting multiple project topics while creating the assignment. The team has added upto 18 new test cases to automatically test the functionality and provided a video explaining that the functionality is now working in various test scenarios. ,,"The tests are divided into six cases, based on the attributes of Private, Staggered, and Microtask assignments, each of which may be true or false.  All combinations of these attributes are tested, EXCEPT {false, false, false} and {true, true, true}.  It is not clear why these two combinations are omitted.  Looking at the functionality, it certainly makes sense to test different values of Staggered and Microtask flags.  But whether or not the assignment is private would seem to be irrelevant to deleting multiple topics.  IFF the assignment is private, other instructors cannot see it.  This doesn't really have anything to do with deleting topics, so eliminating the Private variable would reduce 6 test cases to 4, simplifying the logic.  Other than that, the code seems fairly clear.  I would suggest adding comments before each block of statements (after each blank line) to indicate what the next group is doing.  As far as the writeup is concerned, it is fairly clear, but I and to copy all of the 6 cases over to another page before I could get an overall view of what is being tested.  The explanation could be simplified to avoid repeating the same verbiage at the beginning of all 6 (or 4) cases.  It is good that a video has been created.",

Most of the methods are from instructors view. The code was well written and passed test cases. However, some of the method names are long and not very clear. For some reason, the Github diff shows many more changes than there actually were.  Could this be due to whitespace changes? Although no new test cases were added, the existing test cases seems to be sufficient. Logic in import_team_members has been changed, and a comment indicates that the programmer does not know if it will work! The Travis CI build is failing. The code coverage increased. Overall the team did a good job in refactoring the code.  

Later: The problem with the randomize_all_by_parent method is that you have refactored the create_teams method of teams_controller, renaming it to random_teams, but it calls a create_teams method in Team.rb.  The Team.rb method in turn calls randomize_all_by_parent, but now the association with random team creation is obscured because it's in another class.  If you had named Team>>create_teams Team>>random_teams instead, it would have been much clearer.

Then in get_parent_and_check_if_exists, it is not clear what the parent is.  I am not sure of what the parent of a Team is; is it the assignment that it is participating in?  Then the method should be called get_assignment.  As mentioned in class, a method name that includes a conjunction suggests that a method has two responsibilities, when really it should have only one.

Adding the method new flash_and_redirect_on_update_or_create_error seems to make the code more obscure, because the name contains a conjunction, and it just moves two statements from a method where their purpose is clear to a new method whose name is confusing.

In self.assign_topic_to_first_in_waitlist_post_team_deletion (signed_up_team, signups), the name is very hard to understand, and also seems to imply two responsibilities.  Moreover, why is it a class method, when it takes a signed_up_team as a parameter?  Since the method is in signed_up_team.rb, why isn't the signed_up_team just the receiver?

Then self.copy_assignment does not copy an assignment, but just the teams from the assignment.  So the method name is misleading.",,"The wiki page was well written.

B) After some uncertainty as to whether there would be enough time for team to take on testing work, team agreed to implement some JUnit testing for the new evaluate() and other related methods.  Multiple issues prevented submitted test file from executing as is in standard project environment - test class and method were not public, test code included hard-coded paths referring to local team environment, and additional libraries were used that were not previously in standard environment.  Even with these issues resolved, some tests failed due to other apparent differences between standard environment and team's local environment.  There was no discussion of code coverage or other general indication of thoroughness of testing.     General comments: team started late (at least 10 days after teams assigned) and did not make significant progress until final week.  Few questions were asked until the last few days.

The capability to give instant feedback to students is very important.  However, if that feedback is not quick, students are likely to skip requesting it.  At the moment, it is too slow.  This project could be merged in the expectation that it will be improved, but another alternative is to wait until later to merge, and in the interim to concentrate on removing the rough edges in the project.  

Two in particular should be fixed: The criteria are numbered in the view, and those numbers do not correspond to anything on the rubric form.  So if the rubric is long, it would be quite difficult for the reviewer to figure out what automated feedback referred to which comment.  Second, too much specific information on metrics is encoded into the text.  While some of the info is in configuration files, the help text for the info buttons is in the code.  Also, calls for each metric are programmed into the code, though, depending on how diverse they are, this is perhaps unavoidable.  Finally, we think the code can be more modularized. Currently there are many repetitive blocks of code. For ex; in _response_analysis.html for the getReviewFeedback(), the API call for each type of tag (sentiment, suggestion, etc) is being repeated. Only the API link differs there. So it might be more beneficial to store the API link in the config file and use the variable in the function. The code will be less repetitive.

Code for testing whether a reviewer is a staff member is put into an unrelated class (same method already exists elsewhere in system).
There is a long code clone because the process of creating a mapping and a review is not quite the same as when the reviewer is a non-instructor; a lot of checks needed in that case are not needed here.  But it would have been better to refactor the current code to put the common code into another method.

2) Changes were made looking at the students reviews – good thing. This way they improved their code
3) Few lines of newly added code are not covered with test cases. Test cases should be written for every new line of code.

Tests:
1) Written test cases for new code they wrote.
2) Comments in the code is required. Long lines of code in the spec files but with no comments. ",Team_136,"In the ""What to do"" section, it is not clear whether the two partials you name are new partials.
It is also not clear whether more or less code is being duplicated than in the current system.
It is not clear how the two different partials are used.  How do they interact?
I also find the ""Student end"" section confusing. For example, what is in the ""statistics view""?
When you give a code snippet and say that it does something, you should point out the changes made to accomplish them.  Github diff view would be good for this.  In the current document, I'm left with just the code, and I need to try to figure out what it does and how you changed it.
To summarize, too much code is shown with too little explanation.

 https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza/pull/1533", Yes,"Yes, if hardcoded index is removed.",,96,97,"The travis CI build passes. 
Although the team has identified and have resolved a lot of issues in the system , there are very few code changes. Most of the bug changes are one liner. 

Tests:
2 new tests were added.

Reviews : 
The team got good reviews from most of the people. Some people complained about the missing button from the UI and failing build, so I cross checked with them. The changes are reflected in the deployed application. The last build was failing but the last commit only had code comments. The team was not sure about the issue so i asked them to commit one more dummy comment to re-trigger the build. The build passed without any code changes.

Video:
The video was not submitted with the project.

Feedback:

The team has hardcoded the index of the array to get the models. This will work in the given scenario but is not a scalable solution.

Example : Object.const_get(allowed_models[0]).export_headers(params[:id])",Team_7557,"The documentation looks very good. The team has not only added the probelm statement but also identified few issues that existed in the system. 
The team has clearly explained the code changes.

 https://github.com/expertiza/expertiza/pull/1561", Yes,"Yes, after removing commented-out code.",,95,96,"2 bugs fixed:
1. upon adding a partcipant whose account does not exist was not recieving an email of accunt creation.
2. when the user does not exist , only the user was craeted but was not added as a participitant.

All changes looks fine. The team has added the tests and corrected the tests that were impacted due to the code changes in the system. The password field while uploading the user does not make sense , because a random password is generated verytime a new user is created.

Code that is no longer used is commented out.  It should have been removed!  Commented-out code may distract developers who read the code later, and they may wonder if they might need to re-enable it.

Whenever a new user is created , the mail is sent automatically on user save. We done need to call the mailer explicitly from all the places. Reason why this works:

before_validation :randomize_password, if: ->(user) { user.new_record? && user.password.blank? } # AuthLogic
after_create :email_welcome

The corrected functionality worked fine in the demonstarted video. 
I have tested the fuctionality and that seems to work fine as well now. I have also tested the other flows of email like resetting users password ,etc. Seems to work fine.

Reviews :
The team got very good reviews from the other peers.

Other feedbacks:

Since the email is sent by default whenever a new user is craeted , the email are explicitly being sent at many other places as well which could have been removed by the team as well.

",Team_6784,"Although I disagree with some of the design decisions, the changes are very well documented.

Using the Github diff view is an excellent way to show your changes.

Unfortunately, many of the changes are to comment out code.  Code that is no longer needed should be deleted.

Explanation of the assignment_participant changes was very terse.  More complete explanation would save the next person considerable time.

It is not a good idea to email students whenever they are added to an assignment.  I don't know of any other class where students are emailed every time work is assigned.  Students may want to opt out of this, and there is no way to do so at present.

I wouldn't merge it until that issue is resolved; after that it would probably be OK to merge.",,92,92,"In general, this project made most of the changes that were requested.  But several issues still remain.

Code
• questionnaires_controller, line 172: “question.weight = QUESTION_MAX_SCORE” is just as wrong as the former code, that set the weight to 1.  The weight needs to be set to whatever is filled in on the page where the rubric is created.  Ditto for min_label and max_label.  I don’t see where you actually use the values that are filled in on the form when the rubric is created.
• The same problem comes up at lines 300-308 where the question_size function returns the default values for field sizes, not the actual values for the current question!
• This problem is repeated in quiz_questionnaire_controller.rb
• create_new_questionnaire_obj apparently sets several fields in questionnaires, among which are the min and max score, but not the weight or size.  This seems like an omission.  Also, this is a very nonstandard method name; why isn’t this done in an initialize method?

Tests
• Changes to the tests remove several expectations from questionnaires_controller_spec.rb without any explanation. The only expectation left is “expect(flash[:note]).to be nil”!  Definitely a bad change.
• One reviewer says the code crashed for some questionnaires, and another notes that no new tests were written.",Team_6392,"Good try at describing rationale for changes.  Some of the descriptions could be more helpful, e.g., the one on refactoring the create method, which just said that it had been broken into two parts, not explaining how.  Actually it seems to have been divided into three methods.  The descriptions of removing unnecessary variables and unnecessary parameters are better.
The document would have been more readable if the section numbers (e.g., 6.1 Refactor Create Method) had appeared in the headers to the sections, rather than just in the ToC.
The test plan does not explain why expectations were removed from tests.",

• Ditto for the code in bookmark_rating.rb that calculates an average score: seems to duplicate on_the_fly_calc.rb. 
• Also, there is a magic constant 5.0; what is that? Does it ASSUME that the scale is 1 to 5? This is controlled by min_question_score and max_question_score for the questionnaire, and these variables should be used.
• In questionaires.rb, there is a literal """"Bookmark RatingQuestionnaire"""" in addition to """"BookmarkRatingQuestionnaire""""; there should be only one such rubric..
• According to the code, a teammate of the person who uploaded a bookmark could rate it; is this right?
• bookmarks/list.html.erb is pretty long; it would be better to use one or more partials. Magic constants 0 and 5!

Rough edges
• Bookmarks can be added, and can be viewed by the team whose topic they relate to. But the team has no way of knowing, without clicking on the """"View bookmarks"""" icon, that any bookmarks exist for their topic. A UI change is needed here, even though the project spec did not say to change the UI.On the screen for rating bookmarks, there needs to be more horizontal space between """"Edit"""" and """"Delete"""".

Missing functionality
• The table of bookmarks has an """"Avg. rating"""" and a """"Your rating"""" column. Only """"Avg. rating"""" is populated; """"Your rating"""" is blank, at least for the bookmark that I created and rated.

Apparent bugs
• The """"Back"""" link from bookmark listing """"OSS project and documentation"""" takes me to the signup sheet for Wikipedia contribution … though the assignment number (827) in the URL is for the """"OSS project and documentation"""" assignment. The id=30777, and that evidently takes precedence over the assignment number.

2.1 And as far as I known, if your want to switch the original view to a tabbed view, you can reuse original partials instead of creating new ones.

Team statistics as partial – I didn't quite understand that. [Oh, it's just that you could put more stats on the stats tab, e.g., like in the student score report where they have stats for their team.]

Red background that shows you the current team that's expanded.  This is true also in the tabs … the team that's expanded shows which item is expanded.
Heat grid: there is a link for each participant (why not a single one for team?) [Yes, it usually shows the same reviews for each student, but author feedback & metareviews might be different.  It would be better to put it on the various other tabs, with the same code used.]

Yang: Is there any reason that tabbed view is only applied to instructor's page?
 A. Yes, but it's not a good reason.  We just didn't get it into view_my_scores.

It would be better if instructor can specify several students ids when assigning topics, if those students can be formed into a team, a team can be formed automatically. The ""delete"" icon is not the icon for dropping topics on students UI.

From the writeup, it seems like this might not work if there is more than one slot for a topic.  They differentiate between ""No choosers"" and 1 team being signed up.

""Volume (total # of words), # of diff. words, suggns. given, problems highlighted, problem percent
Averages should be down at the bottom, not duplicated in their own column in each row.
Response ID & reviewer ID ... not really appropriate for the default view.
Different partials, ordering of columns, for students & instructors.
Metrics are not counted unless the review has been submitted.
Could use info buttons to explain the confusing fields.
Review metrics are calculated & put in the db when the instructor looks at them.  Really bad decision!  Should have been discussed with the mentor before deciding on this.  In general, a lot of high-level decisions were made wrongly, which could have been averted if they had discussed it with us first.
Doc doesn't explain how they've written the code.""
""- Many changes, some variable names are meaningless, such as 'o' or 's'.
- Hard-coded offensive words in the code. I remembered I told them to put these words in somw YAML file.
- Instructor end and student end did not share same partials.
- Some irrelative plain text files are commited.
- They wrote test in Minitest framework I think, not RSpec. So their test part cannot be merged into Expertiza.""",,"No relevent information in document. Document only consist of images and code samples, no information about design of project

Beside """"your scores"""" link they create another link called alternative view. This bring students another display of the peer-reviews they have received.

Each question is a row, each column is a review.
There are 26 questions but only 13 of them are scored question (criterion, radio, checkbox). So from line 14 to line 26 are all blank. This looks somehow confusing.

One more thing, the narrator said that """"0 and 1 is red, 2 is orange..."""" is this hard-coded? The score ranges vary by rubrics. 

clicking a row will pop up more details about the feedback for this question.

There is a link: display questions. all the question will pop up if user click this link.

""Shows a list of all scheduled tasks for a particular assgt. (how about for all assgts.?)  No, their UI is just for 1 assgt.
Explain """"delete a task.""""  These are tasks like sending reminders and dropping topics of one-member teams, & dropping outstanding reviews (ones that are selected but not submited).
  Deletion events should be logged (I don't think they are).
These tasks show up in the log (but you have to go to the end of the log, & it doesn't say anything about them, just that they are ScheduledTasks.
(Is there any way to find out what kind of scheduled tasks they are?)
  Clicking on the task # causes an error, but you can se the details by going to Manage > Assignments, & then clicking on the scheduled task list (View delayed jobs)
Added a new task, Drop outstanding reviews (what does this do?)
  Drop reviews that have been selected but not submitted.
Why do you always check """"Apply penalty policy?""""  In the Rails code, if it doesn't have a penalty policy, it won't add the delayed job.
They show the team-formation deadline e-mail arriving (is the mail sent at or before the deadline?)  In advance, 8 hrs. or 24 hrs. (the usual dropdown)
""""Drop one-member"""" should really be drop teams of less than k members ... did we discuss this? (Yes.)
It's not real clear what's going on in the video, because there weren't clear intros of new points.
They finish up by running tests (good), but it's not clear how the tests test what they test.  
  1st is scheduled task test, written according to the existing mailer test.  Copied test to Scheduled Task module.
  Tests whether length of delayed-jobs queue increases.
Why is team-formation reminder sent to students who have already formed teams?  Only sent to people who haven't formed teams; the e-mail could be changed so that it didn't have that proviso.
This looks like a very effective example of teamwork, given the # of questions that everyone answered (Yue answered less than the other 3, though).
.erb files need to be .html.erb.
Also, they created unnecessary migrations (migrations for actions that didnt change table structure).""

""Responsive web design
Good overview of what they are going to do.
Instead of having Rails fetch all data & then render everything, they render the table headings, etc., before fetching data.
We load light items, then use AngularJS to fetch the later items.
They do login page, tree-display page, & users page.
Simultaneous demos show the difference in speed.
One problem: There's too much space betw. lines in their new display, meaning that only ~ 4 courses instead of 6 fit in a window.
  Manish & Pei say they can fix it.
They can now sort columns correctly; this is good.
  Sorting is happening on client side.
Then they show editing users.
Plus, navigation bar disappears from the ribbon at the top if you narrow the window; it becomes a pulldown.
The question is, How hard would it be to do other pages in the same format?  Manish: We have captured the low-level details in the design doc.  Ryan: Major issue was which browser controller system we use, angular or Rails.  If we'd chosen angular, we'd have had to redo all the controllers.
Documentation needs to be updated; they say they will do it.
As to testing, these are all UI changes, so it's hard to see how to test them.""

#420, Instructor can't assign an assgt. to a course.  Andrew put in a fix for part of it, but if you created an assgt. on the Manage screen, it creates an assgt. that is not assigned to a course.  If you went to assign it to a course, you couldn't.  The reason was because the assgt. had a course value of 0, not nil.
Another issue: If you tried to remove a course from an assgt., you couldn't.  That is fixed.
#423 (#428 was fixed by Andrew in the interim): TA can't create or copy an assgt.  It had to be directed to an assgt. method.
TA couldn't copy an assgt. because it couldn't find course_id, & this was fixed by having a special case for a TA.
The assignment-copying bugs: it was CLONING the old assignment rather than DUPing it.  ***This needs to be done for Courses too ***
